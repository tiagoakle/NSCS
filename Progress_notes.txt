Presently the code does all the linear algebra in 

IMPORTANT TO DOS:
The criteria for dual feasibility has to be checked 
Skajaa and Boyd dont match!

DONE:Change the sign of the residuals so that the argument of the solve_atd_direction matches it
The variables in state p_relstop, d_relstop, g_relstop, are calculated proportional 
to the inf norm of [A -b], [A' I -c] and [c',b',1]. We need code to do this
