Presently the code does all the linear algebra in 

IMPORTANT TO DOS:
The criteria for dual feasibility has to be checked 
Skajaa and Boyd dont match!

DONE:Change the sign of the residuals so that the argument of the solve_atd_direction matches it
The variables in state p_relstop, d_relstop, g_relstop, are calculated proportional 
to the inf norm of [A -b], [A' I -c] and [c',b',1]. We need code to do this

Things to check;
0 Figure out when does the non symmetric mehrotra converge with second order info 
0.b Benchmark mehrotra lp vs non_symmetric_long_step in arc_search and secord mode
1 Compare ecos with sedumi, and answer if the neighborhood makes it better, match stopping criteria...
    Instead compare nscs with coneopt and make sure the stopping critera are equal.
2 Correct the nscs stop criteria to match coneopt
3 Debug nscs when it fails in the backtrack while coneopt doesnot (Could be allready fixed, changed the max backtrack iter)
4 Program the 3 directions solver predictor, corrector and second order corrector for arc-search
5 Try long step in entropy problems
6 Make a version of the software that uses both the N-T scaling for the symmetric cones and the atd for the entropy
7 Add SDPs to the implementation
8 Clean up the matlab version 
9 Test the full version
10 C version
