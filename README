Non symmetric cone solver

matlab contains skajaas solver with some modifications which call the C implementation of some parts 
of the solver. 
matlab_minimal contains a version with no heuristics and the minimal implementations
C contains all c code and C/interface contains the C-MATLAB interface code
Solver contains a discontinued version of a matlab code
matlab_explorations contains code to test the calls from matlab to a dylib
suite_sparse_explorations contains code to test the calls to the suite sparse functions.

Compilers:
    The fortran compiler used for this project was downloaded from hpc.sourceforge.net
    The c compliler is the LLVM gcc compiler in Xcode

Libraries 
    Installed OpenBlas
    Installed open mpi to /usr/local (by issuing ./configure --prefix=/usr/local) before make
    (https://sites.google.com/site/dwhipp/tutorials/installing-open-mpi-on-mac-os-x)
    
    Building MUMPS,
        Download from http://mumps.enseeiht.fr/MUMPS_4.10.0.tar.gz
        Unzip and enter the MUMPS directory 
        Copy 
        Make.inc/Makefile.gfortran.PAR  to Makefile.inc
        modify the include directories in Make.inc to point to /usr/local/include where mpif.h is located

        Install scalapack and blasc and compile
